# Overview

This section covers demonstration samples which may be reused to set up the project from the scratch and create your custom application project. Sample concept helps to establish viability, isolate technical issues, construct CI/CD processes and operations. It was developed based on our expertise and best practices.

Demonstration samples use different program languages, various infrastructure and environment types, that allow us to find more suitable sample for the specific project. The code included in these samples is intended to get you going with all application, infrastructure and, even, operations components. It means that each demonstration concept was created as a self-contained solution.
