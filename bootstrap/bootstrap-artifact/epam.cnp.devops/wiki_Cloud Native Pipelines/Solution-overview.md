## Overview

The Cloud Native Pipelines (CNP) accelerator is a solution purposed to speed up delivery process establishment from a DevOps perspective. The solution represents a core project which aggregates a scope of typical modules for CI/CD pipelines, sets of infrastructure modules, and documentation to assist in understanding and establishing the processes. It is built in a modular way and provides not only outgoing functionality but also could be extended by custom modules for the different needs of the delivery teams.

Here is a high-level overview of the "core" approach:

The CNP accelerator is based on Azure DevOps services orchestration capabilities and uses IaC tools (such as Terraform, ARM templates and etc..) for infrastructure provisioning. It might be used as a full product if it suits customer needs, or as a scope of templates and examples for your approach and architecture.

## Business benefits

The CNP accelerator provides such benefits as:
- improves velocity and time to market by speedup bootstrap processes;
- the modular and multi-repo approach used in the solution provides good scalability and manageability in the long-term run;
- transparent and well-understandable CI/CD processes for development teams;
- centralized approach to manage DevOps processes.
As a result, it gives us time, cost and resources savings.
